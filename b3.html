      <h4>Women's T-shirt for a super trendy look with Replay</h4>
    <p>Good morning Zaguline, today I will answer one of the questions you are asking me in this period !!! The trends for this autumn / winter, what can't be missing in our wardrobe !? Let's say that the trends for this fall / winter are many, today I will talk to you about those that in my opinion are must-haves, to always have both summer and winter. Lately I've been obsessed with women's t-shirtswhite with writing, which go well with everything, I like to combine them with slim black jeans, but which can also go well with classic trousers or with a beautiful longuette, I can already imagine a look: T-shirt, bell skirt and a beautiful jacket, in this case we can also opt for sneakers or decolétté depending on the situation in which the outfit is put ... For me these are 2 trends that will never go out of fashion and which you cannot do without. You all know how much a lover I am of online shopping and I do nothing but do continuous research between sites and e-commerce, in fact, looking and browsing the internet I found what I was interested in Replay e-commerce, you all know the famous jeans brand (an Italian brand of denim clothing and smart casualwear) one of a kind and super trendy (Claudio Buziol In 1978, at the age of 21, he decides to register the Replay brand which he considers suitable to convey his desire to “produce casual garments that reinterpret the American style of the 1950s”. ) On the site you will find many garments, in addition to jeans and t-shirts you can find shirts, accessories, shoes, in short, everything that can satisfy any type of person and age!</p>
    <img src="img/blog/blog3/b3, i.jpg" alt="">
    <p>As you can see, I chose slim black jeans, a black belt and a t-shirt with black writing just to match everything perfectly, a classic look, but at the same time trendy. For the amount of choice I found on the site, I was undecided on what to wear as a jacket, so I'll show you here what struck me, so you can help me choose.</p>
<div id="list">
    <li>I really liked this leather jacket, biker jacket, but with special and unique finishes, for a very punk / chic look.  </li>
        <img src="img/blog/blog3/b3, ii.png" alt="">
  
    <li>Or this Denim Jacket with pink fur, to give a romantic touch to my outfit </li>
        <img src="img/blog/blog3/b3, iii.png" alt="">
    
    <li>Or a beautiful 3/4 wool coat, single-breasted with checks, for a very Business casual outfit </li>
        <img src="img/blog/blog3/b3, iv.png" alt="">
   
</div>
<P>I would say that they are 3 different outerwear of their kind and as you can see with a basic look you can play in creating different styles, just change your jacket or shoes to have 3 different occasions to show off your look. Now I need your help, by now you know me well can you help me in choosing the outerwear? What do you recommend for my outfit? </p>
